# my-python-journey
Welcome to my personal repository, where I document my ongoing learning journey in Python and Data Science.
I document and share my Python learning journey through original materials from my books and personal scripts.
This project contains scripts, notebooks, practical projects, and exercises developed to strengthen my programming skills and apply techniques in data analysis, machine learning, and automation.
